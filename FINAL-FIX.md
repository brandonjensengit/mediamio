# Final ObservableObject Fix

## The Root Cause

The error `Type 'AuthenticationService' does not conform to protocol 'ObservableObject'` was caused by:

1. `AuthenticationService` was marked as `@MainActor class ... : ObservableObject`
2. But it referenced `JellyfinAPIClient.shared` (a singleton)
3. Swift's `@StateObject` cannot properly initialize types that depend on singletons created outside of SwiftUI's lifecycle

## The Solution

Removed **all** singleton patterns from ObservableObject classes:

### Before (Broken):
```swift
@MainActor
class JellyfinAPIClient: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = JellyfinAPIClient()  // ‚ùå Singleton
    // ...
}

@MainActor
class AuthenticationService: ObservableObject {
    private let apiClient = JellyfinAPIClient.shared  // ‚ùå Using singleton
    // ...
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```swift
@MainActor
class JellyfinAPIClient: ObservableObject {
    // ‚úÖ No singleton - just a regular class
    init() {
        // ...
    }
}

@MainActor
class AuthenticationService: ObservableObject {
    private let apiClient: JellyfinAPIClient  // ‚úÖ Instance property

    init() {
        self.apiClient = JellyfinAPIClient()  // ‚úÖ Create new instance
        // ...
    }
}
```

## What Was Changed

### 1. JellyfinAPIClient.swift
- **Removed**: `static let shared = JellyfinAPIClient()`
- **Result**: Now a regular ObservableObject class

### 2. AuthenticationService.swift
- **Changed**: `private let apiClient = JellyfinAPIClient.shared`
- **To**: `private let apiClient: JellyfinAPIClient` + initialized in `init()`
- **Already removed**: `static let shared = AuthenticationService()`

### 3. KeychainHelper (No Change Needed)
- Still uses `KeychainHelper.shared` - this is **fine** because:
  - KeychainHelper is NOT an ObservableObject
  - It's just a utility class with no state
  - Singletons are okay for utilities, just not for ObservableObjects used with @StateObject

## Why This Works

SwiftUI's `@StateObject` requires:
1. ‚úÖ The type must be `ObservableObject`
2. ‚úÖ The type must be instantiable via `init()`
3. ‚úÖ Dependencies must not be singletons created outside SwiftUI
4. ‚úÖ Must be decorated with `@MainActor` for thread safety

All requirements are now met!

## Dependency Chain

```
MediaMioApp
    ‚Üì @StateObject
AuthenticationService (ObservableObject, @MainActor)
    ‚Üì created in init()
JellyfinAPIClient (ObservableObject, @MainActor)
    ‚Üì singleton is OK here
KeychainHelper (regular class)
```

## Build Instructions

1. **Open Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open /Users/brandonjensen/code/MediaMio/MediaMio.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Clean Build:**
   - Press **‚áß‚åòK** (Shift+Command+K)

3. **Build:**
   - Press **‚åòB** (Command+B)

4. **Expected Result:**
   ‚úÖ **Zero errors** - Project builds successfully!

## If You Still See Errors

If the error persists after these changes:

1. **Restart Xcode** completely
2. **Delete Derived Data:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MediaMio-*
   ```
3. **Clean and rebuild** in Xcode

## Technical Explanation

The issue was subtle:

- `@StateObject` in SwiftUI creates and owns the lifecycle of an ObservableObject
- When you mark a class with `@MainActor`, Swift needs to ensure thread safety
- If that class has dependencies that are singletons (created on unknown threads), Swift cannot guarantee the `@MainActor` isolation
- By removing singletons and creating instances in `init()`, everything is created on the MainActor

This is a common issue when migrating from singleton patterns to SwiftUI's declarative state management.

## Summary

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `JellyfinAPIClient.swift` - Removed singleton
- ‚úÖ `AuthenticationService.swift` - Removed singleton, creates APIClient instance

**What This Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ ObservableObject conformance error
- ‚úÖ Proper SwiftUI state management
- ‚úÖ Thread safety with @MainActor
- ‚úÖ Testability (can inject dependencies)

**Status:** üéâ All compilation errors should now be resolved!
