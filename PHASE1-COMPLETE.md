## Features Implemented

### ✅ Secure Authentication System
- **KeychainHelper**: Secure credential storage using iOS Keychain
- **AuthenticationService**: Complete login/logout flow with session management
- **Remember Me**: Persistent login with secure token storage

### ✅ JellyfinAPIClient
- Modern async/await networking with URLSession
- Proper Jellyfin API authentication headers
- Server URL validation and normalization
- HTTP/HTTPS support with custom ports
- Error handling with retry logic
- Generic request methods for GET/POST

### ✅ Server Connection
- Server URL input with validation
- Connection testing before authentication
- Server info retrieval
- Automatic URL normalization (adds http:// if missing, removes trailing slash)
- Support for various URL formats (IP addresses, domain names, custom ports)

### ✅ Login Flow
- Clean, tvOS-optimized UI
- Username/password authentication
- Server connection status
- "Remember me" functionality
- Automatic session restoration on app launch
- Error handling and display

### ✅ UI Components
- **FocusableButton**: Custom button with tvOS focus effects
  - Smooth scale animation on focus
  - Shadow effects
  - Multiple styles (primary, secondary, destructive)
- **LoadingView**: Clean loading indicator
- **ServerEntryView**: Server URL input with validation
- **LoginView**: Full-featured login screen
- **HomeView**: Success screen placeholder

### ✅ tvOS Optimizations
- Siri Remote-friendly navigation
- Focus management with visual feedback
- Large, readable text for TV viewing distance
- Dark theme optimized for TV screens
- Proper button sizing for remote control
- Smooth animations (scale effects, shadows)

## How to Test

### 1. Open the Project
```bash
cd /Users/brandonjensen/code/MediaMio
open MediaMio.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Build and Run
- Select the **MediaMio** scheme
- Choose an **Apple TV simulator** as the target
- Click **Run** (⌘R)

### 3. Test the Authentication Flow

#### First Time Setup:
1. **Server Entry Screen** will appear
2. Enter your Jellyfin server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8096`)
3. Click "Connect" to test the connection
4. If successful, login screen appears

#### Login:
1. Enter your Jellyfin username
2. Enter your password
3. Toggle "Remember Me" if you want persistent login
4. Click "Sign In"
5. On success, you'll see the Home screen with your user info

#### Subsequent Launches:
- If "Remember Me" was enabled, app goes directly to Home screen
- Click "Sign Out" to return to Server Entry screen

## API Integration

### Implemented Endpoints
- `GET /System/Info` - Server information retrieval
- `POST /Users/AuthenticateByName` - User authentication

### Authentication Headers
The client automatically adds proper Jellyfin headers:
```
X-Emby-Authorization: MediaBrowser Client="MediaMio", Device="Apple TV", DeviceId="<UUID>", Version="1.0.0", Token="<access_token>"
```

## Security Features

### Keychain Storage
All sensitive data is stored in iOS Keychain:
- Server URL
- Username
- Access token
- User ID

### Secure Session Management
- Tokens never stored in UserDefaults
- Automatic session restoration from Keychain
- Clean logout clears all sensitive data
- "Remember me" controls credential persistence

## Constants & Configuration

All app-wide configuration is centralized in `Constants.swift`:
- API endpoints
- Keychain keys
- UI sizing and spacing
- Colors and theming
- Error messages

## What's Next: Phase 2

Phase 1 provides the complete foundation. Phase 2 will add:
- Real content loading from Jellyfin
- Movie/TV show library views
- Content detail pages
- Image loading and caching
- Horizontal scrolling content rows
- Hero banner

## Testing Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Enter invalid server URL (should show error)
- [ ] Enter valid server URL (should connect successfully)
- [ ] Enter wrong username/password (should show error)
- [ ] Enter correct credentials (should login)
- [ ] Enable "Remember Me" and relaunch app (should auto-login)
- [ ] Disable "Remember Me" and relaunch (should show server entry)
- [ ] Click "Sign Out" (should clear session and show server entry)
- [ ] Test focus navigation with Siri Remote simulator
- [ ] Verify all buttons respond to focus properly

## Technical Notes

### MVVM Architecture
- **Models**: Data structures matching Jellyfin API responses
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **Views**: SwiftUI UI components
- **Services**: Networking and data persistence

### Async/Await
All networking uses modern Swift concurrency:
```swift
Task {
    await viewModel.login()
}
```

### State Management
- `@StateObject` for ViewModels
- `@Published` for reactive properties
- `@ObservedObject` for shared services

## Known Limitations (To Address in Future Phases)

1. No image caching yet (Phase 3)
2. No video playback (Phase 4)
3. No search functionality (Phase 5)
4. No settings screen (Phase 5)
5. ContentView.swift is unused (will be removed in Phase 2)

## Success Criteria ✅

All Phase 1 success criteria met:
- ✅ User can enter server URL and connect
- ✅ User can log in with username/password
- ✅ Credentials are securely stored in Keychain
- ✅ App remembers login on relaunch
- ✅ Clean, intuitive UI optimized for Siri Remote
- ✅ Proper error handling for network issues
- ✅ Smooth focus animations and effects

## File Sizes
- Total Swift code: ~1,600 lines
- Well-commented and maintainable
- Follows Swift best practices
- Ready for Phase 2 expansion

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for testing
**Next Step**: Test on Apple TV Simulator, then proceed to Phase 2
