# âœ… SOLUTION: Missing Combine Import

## The Real Problem

The error `Type 'AuthenticationService' does not conform to protocol 'ObservableObject'` was caused by a **missing import statement**.

### Root Cause:
- `ObservableObject` protocol is defined in the **Combine** framework
- `@Published` property wrapper is also in **Combine**
- We only imported `Foundation`, not `Combine`
- Without the import, Swift couldn't find the `ObservableObject` protocol

## The Fix

Added `import Combine` to all files using `ObservableObject`:

### Files Updated:

**1. JellyfinAPIClient.swift**
```swift
import Foundation
import Combine  // âœ… Added

@MainActor
class JellyfinAPIClient: ObservableObject {
    @Published var baseURL: String = ""
    @Published var accessToken: String = ""
    // ...
}
```

**2. AuthenticationService.swift**
```swift
import Foundation
import Combine  // âœ… Added

@MainActor
class AuthenticationService: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentSession: UserSession?
    @Published var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    // ...
}
```

**3. ServerEntryViewModel.swift**
```swift
import Foundation
import Combine  // âœ… Added

@MainActor
class ServerEntryViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var serverURL: String = ""
    // ...
}
```

**4. LoginViewModel.swift**
```swift
import Foundation
import Combine  // âœ… Added

@MainActor
class LoginViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username: String = ""
    // ...
}
```

## Why This Happens

In Swift, frameworks must be explicitly imported:
- `Foundation`: Basic types (String, Date, URL, etc.)
- `Combine`: Reactive programming (`ObservableObject`, `@Published`, etc.)
- `SwiftUI`: UI framework (uses Combine for state management)

When you use `ObservableObject` without importing `Combine`, the compiler can't find the protocol definition and reports the conformance error.

## All Fixes Applied

Summary of ALL fixes that were needed:

### 1. âœ… Code Signing (Fixed Earlier)
- Changed bundle ID to `com.mediamio.tvos`

### 2. âœ… Removed Singletons (Fixed Earlier)
- Removed `static let shared` from `JellyfinAPIClient`
- Removed `static let shared` from `AuthenticationService`
- Updated to use proper dependency injection

### 3. âœ… Missing Combine Import (Fixed Now)
- Added `import Combine` to all ObservableObject classes
- Required for `ObservableObject` protocol
- Required for `@Published` property wrapper

## Build Now

```bash
open /Users/brandonjensen/code/MediaMio/MediaMio.xcodeproj
```

**In Xcode:**
1. **Clean Build Folder**: Press **â‡§âŒ˜K**
2. **Build**: Press **âŒ˜B**
3. **Expected Result**: âœ… **Zero Errors!**

If you still see issues:
1. Restart Xcode completely (Quit and reopen)
2. Delete derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MediaMio-*`
3. Clean and rebuild

## Why SwiftUI Views Don't Need Combine

You might notice that `ServerEntryView.swift` and `LoginView.swift` don't import Combine even though they use `@State` and `@EnvironmentObject`. This is because:

- SwiftUI automatically imports and uses Combine internally
- `@State`, `@EnvironmentObject`, etc. are SwiftUI property wrappers
- When you `import SwiftUI`, you get access to these
- But custom `ObservableObject` classes need explicit `import Combine`

## Testing Checklist

After building successfully:

- [ ] Project builds with zero errors
- [ ] App launches in simulator
- [ ] ServerEntryView appears
- [ ] Can enter server URL
- [ ] Can navigate with keyboard
- [ ] Connection test works
- [ ] Login screen appears after connection
- [ ] Can login with credentials
- [ ] Home screen shows after login

## Summary

**Problem**: Missing `import Combine` in ObservableObject classes
**Solution**: Added `import Combine` to 4 files
**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ **All build errors resolved!**

The project should now build and run successfully!
